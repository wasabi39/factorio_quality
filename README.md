# factorio_quality
Markov chain simulations of production quality in the video game Factorio. WIP.

# Running the project

To run the Streamlit app, run ```docker-compose up --build```. Then the project can be found in ´´´localhost:5000/´´´. Alternatively, the script factorio_quality_calculator.py can be run directly in a venv if one doesn't need a UI.

# Todo
Make frontend functional
Unit tests
API / separation of concerns
Proper directory structure
Adjust Pylint Github workflow to suit the project's needs better.
Cache dependencies in Dockerfile.
